*Picture if you will, a [Flash-based catalog reader](http://www.fineartlamps.com/digital-catalog/Fine-Art-Lamps-Catalog-Volume-200/) on an inventory supplier's company website. This catalog, however, is no ordinary catalog. It has been endowed, by its creator, with a quite unusual "feature set" - the kind of "features" one would normally find embedded on a random Myspace page circa 2006. The culmination of this viewer's oddities may best be summed up with two words, found on a button in the viewer's toolbar...*

# *Mute Catalog* (partial rough draft)

*(words and scenario by Stuart P. Bentley)*

Lewis, Accounts Payable drone, goes to see Nick Masterson, IT department "chair" (read: only IT worker) at Masterson Manumatics. He asks how to do some Accounts Receivable thing to find his budget, and Nick sneers that he works in Payable, and that if he wants to get a budget, he needs to email someone whose job it is to access the budgets instead of trying to overstep his bounds doing other people's jobs. This is a business, after all.

"You do remember how to *eee*-mail, right, Lewis? We don't have to call Wayline back in and have them do *another* little training seminar *just for you*, do we?"

"Oh, uh, no, Nick, it's okay, I know about how to e-mail. I'm doing e-mails almost every day."

"C-could it maybe... play that song?"

"... I... You want it to... what song?"

"Um, that one, you know, it's the one that goes..." Lewis put his lips together and blew.

"... I didn't catch... did you just whistle it? I couldn't hear much..."

"Oh, uh, it's, um, it's like, 'do woo woo dee doo woo woo, do dooo, wee doo'..."

"... You mean *Moves Like Jagger*?"

"Oh, uh, is that... uh, why is it called that?"

"I... I think that's the song you're talking about -"

In the background, Lewis heard Jonas clack away some command into his computer window.

"It's this one? That's the chorus, or whatever? I'm not totally a music guy."

Through the static on the line, Lewis heard the noisy notes of the tune he was gesturing for.

"Yes! It's that. Can you do that? Have it have that? How much would it cost to have that?"

"Um, that's, uh, it would be pretty si- I'm..." Jonas cleared his throat. "A hundred... fifty dollars, extra."

Lewis flinched, but quickly gathered his nerve, only hesitating for a few seconds before Jonas followed, "Maybe a hundred twenty five. If it's okay that I keep it simple, you know."

"Oh, sure," said Lewis, "the music is simple. What did you say it's called again?"

"This? It's *Moves Like Jagger*. Song's by Maroon 5."

"Okay. Oh, thank you, Jonas, you've been very helpful. Thank you for being very patient with me. I'm going to send you the revised work order within the hour, is that okay? Will you be ready to work on that work order?"

After double-checking the org chart that Kayla had kindly printed out for him to ensure that Nick Masterson wasn't in the hierarchy to sign off on the purchase order, Lewis surreptitiously placed a new line into the work order's requirements:

> deliverable must play song "Move the Dagger" by the band "Marroon-5"

"Nice job commissioning that new catalog, Lewis. Very hip and modern - really shows that we're a forward-leaning company with its eye on what's ahead, in the future."
